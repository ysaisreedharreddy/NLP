Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and models, providing a brief summary of how they are implemented. These topics are ideal for sharing knowledge in a professional setting like LinkedIn or for creating comprehensive repositories on GitHub to showcase implementation skills.

1. Bag of Words (BoW)
Bag of Words is a method in natural language processing where a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.
Key Steps:
Text normalization (removing punctuation, lowercasing, etc.)
Tokenization (splitting text into words or tokens)
Counting the frequency of each word
Transforming text into a numerical form that can be fed into a machine learning model
Applications: Document classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis.

2. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling.
Key Steps:
Calculate term frequency for each word in each document.
Calculate inverse document frequency, which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.
Multiply the two numbers to produce the TF-IDF score for each word in each document.
Applications: Search engines, keyword extraction, document similarity.

3. Word2Vec
Word2Vec is a group of related models used to produce word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words that capture the context of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words, etc.
Key Steps:
Preprocess text data: tokenization, removing stopwords.
Choose architecture: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) or Skip-Gram model.
Train the model: adjust weights of the neural network to predict the context given a word (CBOW) or a word given its context (Skip-Gram).
Use the learned word vectors for tasks like finding similar words, analogies, etc.
Applications: Language modeling, document clustering, text similarity, machine translation.
